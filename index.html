        <p>The key monetization channel for legacy web, and arguably they are most healthy monetization channel for businesses on the legacy web (especially when compared to ad/surveillance) based models. They are arguably more healthy than a token based economic system (depending upon the vesting model of the ICO) because...</p>

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>We suggest the reason for this standard is interoperability - we want wallets to understand that you’re about to sign a recurring payment contract so that they can present you with a UI that summarises the agreement you’re about to enter into. As your wallet now knows you’ve entered into a subscription contract it can also provide appropriate UI for managing and cancelling your subscriptions in future.</p>
        <p>We also believe that creating momentum for Saas models in the Ethereum space is critical, and believe that the standard is a trojan horse for doing so.</p>
